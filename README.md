# UkeTheHeights
This is a web app that features a variety of songs and teaches the user to play the ukulele with step by step chords. We created this project for Hack the Heights 2019 at Boston College. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

www.uketheheights.com is still in progress, trying to use FTP to transfer these pages to a live site. Domain is registered until 4/14/20.
