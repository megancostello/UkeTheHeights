# UkeTheHeights
This is a web app that features a variety of songs and teaches the user to play the ukulele with step by step chords. We created this project for Hack the Heights 2019 at Boston College. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Visit www.uketheheights.com to see the project live until April 14, 2020!

www.uketheheights.com was created using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) via FileZilla with a free web domain and hosting from MLH through Domain.com. The domain will be registered and functional until 4/14/20.
